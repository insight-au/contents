<i>"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star .... Like a diamond in the sky"</i><br /><br />
 goes a popular nursery rhyme, and several poets have written verses eulogising the sky and the stars.

Astronomy(<i><span style="color:#7F0000; font-weight:600;">Jyotisham</span></i>)had been a great strength of ancient Indian scientists and they accomplished a great deal in this area.
