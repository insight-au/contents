In ancient India, mathematics or 'Ganita' was the 'Science of Calculations'. It was primarily studied in the context of numerical computation and geometric measurement. Most of the Indian mathematical work can be found as a part of 'Jyotisha' or Astronomy. This is because Astronomy, which dealt with the measurement of time using the heavenly bodies, involved high levels of sophisticated numerical computation. Mathematics in ancient India was so well developed that the body of knowledge was not restricted only to the elite scholars. It was prevalently used even by the common people in their daily activities and profession.	
</p>


<p>
The history of Indian mathematics dates back to the vedic period (around 1500 B.C.) The 'Sulbasutras' of this vedic age are texts on rules for altar construction. They are the oldest texts on Indian mathematics. They contain the general enunciation of the Pythagoras theorem,  approximate value for square root of 2, methods of transforming one figure to another etc... Indians also used the decimal place-value system of representing the numbers. They had a representation for zero. The origin of the decimal place-value system in India was sometime around 1st century B.C.

<p>You've probably heard of the glorious achievements of traditional Indian thinkers, astronomers and philosophers. You would've also known about the work of such intellectuals in the field of mathematics. But did you know that mathematics was also used in day-to-day activities by the common man? It is this simplicity of Indian Mathematics that we would like to introduce you to. We are going to present to you some of the basic techniques where you can experience the power of Indian Mathematics.
