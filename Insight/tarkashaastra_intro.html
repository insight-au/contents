Logical reasoning is the most special among all of man's different faculties. He observes, interacts and arrives at conclusions. It is that ability which sets him apart from all other beings. He has always wished to know about the things around him, the way they work and why they work the way they do. Tarka Shaastra, which is  a branch of <i><span style="color:#7F0000; font-weight:600;">Nyaya</span></i>, was the science in which a complete understanding of the universe was attempted. Rules were specified for classifying all that we see around us and for inferring other rules from their behaviour.
