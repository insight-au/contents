
It is not possible to provide a straight forward answer to this question. A few thoughts are provided for you to find the answer.

Curiosity is one of the most distinguishing characterisitcs of the human mind. Throughout the ages, numerous wonderful discoveries, inventions and advancements have been made, largely because of this urge to know. But, looking back at the annals of history, we find that curiosity alone is not enough. Only when combined with the ability to look at things a bit differently, does curiosity make the potent force that drives humans towards making these discoveries.

Every civilization has a body of scientific knowledge associated with it. The development of this knowledge is fuelled by the dictates of day to day needs. Farmers need to know the right time to plant the crops and architects need to measure the structures they build. The civilizations that flourished in India too had such a body of knowledge. This body of scientific knowledge is unique in the sense that it is wide in scope and exhaustive in depth. Further, the approach of Indians towards the various sciences was quite different from the modern approach. In India, the emphasis was working in harmony with nature rather than trying to conquer nature.

In this workshop we present some aspects of this body of knowledge so that you too can develop this sense of curiosity and the ability to look at things differently.
